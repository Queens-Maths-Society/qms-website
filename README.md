# Queens' Mathematics Society Website

This is the Github for the QMS Website!

The current iteration of the website was designed and implemented by Ben Balaam, QMS Secretary 2025. This was with help from the other committee members and was partially based on the previous version of the website, designed by Navid Alam, QMS Secretary 2015 and last updated by Erin Keeling, QMS Secretary 2024.

Currently this is just a static site, so there is no build process, just put the files into the correct place on the SRCF server and it *should* work.

Any questions should be directed to whoever is the current QMS Secretary, emailable at: <qms-secretary@srcf.net>.
